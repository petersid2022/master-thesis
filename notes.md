> auto-regressive sampling vs speculative sampling

## The problem
Transformer decoding remains a highly costly and inefficient process in this regime. Since each new token depends on the past, many such transformer calls are required to sample a new sequence. Whilst transformers can be trained efficiently and in parallel on TPUs and GPUs, samples are typically drawn auto-regressively. For most applications, auto-regressive sampling (ArS) is highly memory bandwidth bound and thus cannot make effective use of modern accelerator hardware (Shazeer, 2019). A memory bound model call only generates a single token for every sequence in the batch, hence generating multiple tokens introduces a large amount of latency in any system which makes use of it.

## Solution
Speculative Sampling (SpS): an algorithm for accelerating transformer decoding by enabling the generation of multiple tokens from each transformer call.

## Algorithm
1. Generate a short draft of length K (draft model)
2. Score the draft using the lager model (i.e. the model from we wish to sample from - target model)
3. Accept a subset of K from left to right (via a rejection sampling scheme) recovering the distribution of the target model in the process.

## Notes
1. The next token might sometimes be “obvious” therefore if there is strong agreement between the draft and target model’s distributions on a given token or sub-sequence of tokens, this setup permits the generation of multiple tokens each time the target model is called.
2. The latency of parallel scoring of short continuations, generated by a faster but less powerful draft model, is comparable to that of sampling a single token from the larger target mode

## Choice of Draft Models
1. Incorporating draft generation into the target model and train the model from the start.
2. Using sequence level distillation to generate a second model which predicts K tokens in parallel.
3. Set a portion of the activations of the target model as an input to the draft model, and train the draft model with this input.

## Conclusion
We show that the expected acceptance rate of draft tokens is sufficient to offset the overhead of the drafting process for large language models (LLMs), resulting in an effective and practical method for reducing sampling latency without the need for modifying the target model or biasing the sample distribution.

## Key takeaways
1. Speculative decoding : an optimization technique for inference that makes educated guesses about future tokens while generating the current token.
2. All within a single forward pass. No [backpatching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compiler-design/backpatching-in-compiler-design/)
3. Based on the premise that the model is powerful enough to predict multiple tokens in a single forward pass.
4. It incorporates a verification mechanism to ensure the correctness of these speculated tokens
5. Thereby guaranteeing that the overall output of speculative decoding is identical to that of vanilla decoding.
