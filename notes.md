# [Accelerating Large Language Model Decoding with Speculative Sampling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01318)

1. Speculative Sampling (SpS): an algorithm for accelerating transformer decoding by enabling the generation of multiple tokens from each transformer call.
2. The latency of parallel scoring of short continuations, generated by a faster but less powerful draft model, is comparable to that of sampling a single token from the larger target mode
3. Transformer decoding remains a highly costly and inefficient process in this regime
4. Since each new token depends on the past, many such transformer calls are required to sample a new sequence
